    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <div class="welcome-text">
        <p>&emsp; This is a website I've written for educational purposes. My goal was to use Spring Boot and its
            modules to provide a modern web application based on the most efficient technologies.</p>
        <p>&emsp; I decided to combine this goal with my second passion - cinematography. The idea was simple - a web
            application designed to download, store and display data from Filmweb website.</p>
        <p>The project isn't finished yet, but if you can see it, it means I've decided it's ready to show to the
            world.</p>
